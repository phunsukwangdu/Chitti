# Chitti
AI Virtual assistant based on AIML.<br>
** To start Chitti virtual assistant ** : `python chitti.py`<br>

** To exit Chitt **: just say "exit"<br>
It is a attempt to make a simple personal assistant that takes speech as input and says the processed data based on AIML.AIML is simple pattern matching and does not implement any sort of machine learning.Chitti is only compatible with linux and python2 as of now.In near future Chitti will be capable of doing simple tasks such as opening webbrowser and various small activities.Futher instructions and enhancements will be added soon :P.
